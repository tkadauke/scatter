Scatter
=======

scatter is a tool to easily distribute rubygems on your machines. Once configured, you can install a gem to an unlimited amount of machines with just one command.

For communication, scatter uses SSH and SCP. It is recommended that you use SSH Keys on every machine that you want to distribute gems to.

Installation
------------

  gem install scatter    # you might need sudo rights

Configuration
-------------

To configure your machine to use scatter, run

  scatter init

Remotes and nodes
-----------------

In scatter, hosts are called nodes and groups of hosts are called remotes. For web developers, possible remotes would be "staging", "ci" and "production". Every node is associated with a remote. To address a node, either use the node name or the fully qualified name, which is <remote_name>/<node_name>.

To add a remote, use

  scatter remote add <name>

To list remotes, use

  scatter remote list

To remove a remote, use

  scatter remote rm <name>

To add a node, use

  scatter node add <remote> <name> <username>@<hostname>

for example

  scatter node add production app01 me@app01.example.com

To remove a node, use either of

  scatter node rm <node_name>
  scatter node rm <remote_name>/<node_name>
  scatter node rm <remote_name> <node_name>

To list a remote's nodes, use

  scatter node list <remote_name>

Distributing gems
-----------------

To push a gem to a remote or node, use

  scatter push <gem_file_name> <remote_name>
  scatter push <gem_file_name> <node_name>
  scatter push <gem_file_name> <remote_name>/<node_name>

For example:

  scatter push activesupport-2.3.5.gem production

Listing gems
------------

To list the gems on a node, use

  scatter list <node_name>
  scatter list <remote_name>/<node_name>

Callbacks
---------

Whenever scatter pushes a gem to a node, it calls the command "scatter receive <gem_file_name>" on the receiving node. This command is used to trigger a post-receive callback, which can be any kind of script. The file name of the callback is $HOME/.scatter/post-receive and must be executable. Scatter supplies the name of the gem as the first parameter to the post-receive script.
